    <h2>Privacy Notice</h2>
    <p class="muted">
      This Privacy Notice explains how SpeakOut MindCheck (“we”, “our”, “us”) handles information
      when you use the MindCheck web app, including screenings, volunteer training, and monitoring tools.
    </p>
    <p class="pill">Aligned with Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR) & Nigeria Data Protection Act (NDPA)</p>

    <h3>1. Who we are</h3>
    <p>
      SpeakOut Mental Health Outreach is a Nigerian non-profit initiative providing school and community
      mental-health education, digital screenings, and safe volunteer support pathways.
    </p>

    <h3>2. What information we collect</h3>
    <p>MindCheck is designed to minimise personal data. We generally collect:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Anonymous app usage data:</b> mood check-ins, completed tips, quiz scores, and badges (stored in your browser and aggregate logs).</li>
      <li><b>Non-identifying logs:</b> short notes such as “anxiety & sleep — shared breathing exercise; offered clinic list” without names or contact details.</li>
      <li><b>Certificate data (if you request a certificate):</b> your name, quiz score, certificate ID, and date of issue.</li>
      <li><b>Technical data:</b> browser, device type, and approximate usage analytics via Plausible (privacy-friendly, no cookies / no cross-site tracking).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do <b>not</b> ask you to type full names, phone numbers, or exact addresses inside the app for help-seeking conversations.</p>

    <h3>3. How we use the information</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide mood check-ins, resources, and volunteer training content.</li>
      <li>To monitor core indicators (number of contacts, screenings, referrals, follow-ups) for programme quality and grant reporting in aggregated form.</li>
      <li>To issue and verify volunteer training certificates using certificate IDs.</li>
      <li>To improve the app safely (for example, usability and performance analytics).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Legal basis and consent</h3>
    <p>
      For Nigerian users, we rely on:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Legitimate interest:</b> providing low-barrier mental-health support tools with minimal data.</li>
      <li><b>Consent:</b> when you enter your name for a certificate or choose to contact us directly by email, phone, or WhatsApp.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Data retention</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Browser-stored data (mood history, points, saved tips) stays on your device until you clear your browser storage.</li>
      <li>Programme monitoring logs and certificate registers are retained only as long as needed for reporting and audit, then aggregated or anonymised.</li>
      <li>We aim to review raw logs regularly and delete any information that is no longer required.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6. Sharing and security</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>We do not sell your data.</li>
      <li>Limited volunteers and coordinators may see programme-level aggregates (for example, total screenings per school).</li>
      <li>Where we use cloud tools (for example, Google Workspace, Plausible), we choose providers with strong security and data-protection practices.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>7. Your rights</h3>
    <p>Under NDPR / NDPA and similar frameworks, you can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ask what information we hold about you (for example, certificate records).</li>
      <li>Request correction or deletion of your personal details where applicable.</li>
      <li>Withdraw consent where processing is based on consent (for example, close a certificate record linked to your name, if lawful to do so).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      To exercise these rights, contact us at
      <a href="mailto:speaaakout@gmail.com">speaaakout@gmail.com</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>8. Children and safeguarding</h3>
    <p>
      MindCheck is often used in school outreach. We encourage children to use the app together with a trusted
      adult or teacher. Where a safeguarding concern arises (for example, serious risk of harm), volunteers follow
      escalation protocols, including calling emergency services or designated safeguarding leads.
    </p>

    <h3>9. Changes to this notice</h3>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Notice as our programme grows or as regulations change. Major changes will be
      announced through our usual communication channels.
    </p>
