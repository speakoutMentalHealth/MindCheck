    <h2>Terms of Use</h2>
    <p class="muted">
      These Terms govern your use of the SpeakOut MindCheck web app and related pages
      (including screenings, volunteer training, monitoring, and certificate verification).
    </p>

    <h3>1. Not an emergency or clinical service</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>MindCheck does <b>not</b> replace a doctor, hospital, or emergency service.</li>
      <li>If you or someone else is in immediate danger, call your local emergency number (in Nigeria: <b>112</b>) or go to the nearest health facility.</li>
      <li>Screenings and tips are informational and supportive only; they are not a diagnosis or prescription.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Eligibility and responsible use</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>MindCheck is designed for university students, youth, caregivers, and community members aged 16+.</li>
      <li>We encourage younger users to access the app together with a parent, guardian, or teacher.</li>
      <li>You agree not to misuse the app, upload harmful content, or attempt to break security controls.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Safeguarding and escalation</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Volunteers and coordinators follow a safeguarding and escalation policy when there is serious risk of harm, violence, or abuse.</li>
      <li>Where necessary, volunteers may escalate to emergency services, school authorities, or safeguarding leads even if the person is worried about disclosure—safety comes first.</li>
      <li>We keep minimum-necessary records of such escalations (date, concern, action taken) in line with our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Notice</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Certificates and verification</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Volunteer training certificates are issued based on quiz results and attendance, at our discretion.</li>
      <li>We may revoke or correct a certificate if it was issued in error or if there is evidence of misuse or misrepresentation.</li>
      <li>Third-party organisations may verify certificates using the verification tool or by contacting us directly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Intellectual property</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Content in the MindCheck app (text, graphics, training modules) is owned by SpeakOut Mental Health Outreach or used with permission.</li>
      <li>You may not copy, resell, or host our content elsewhere without written permission, except for limited personal or educational use.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6. Data protection and privacy</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Our handling of any personal data is described in the <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Notice</a>.</li>
      <li>We aim to comply with Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR) and successor laws such as the Nigeria Data Protection Act (NDPA).</li>
      <li>By using the app, you acknowledge that anonymised and aggregate data may be used to improve services and report to funders.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>7. Limitation of liability</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>We provide MindCheck “as is”, as a supportive tool and not a substitute for professional care.</li>
      <li>To the extent allowed by law, SpeakOut and its volunteers are not liable for indirect or consequential losses arising from use of the app.</li>
      <li>This does not remove any rights you have under applicable Nigerian law that cannot be limited.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>8. Changes to these Terms</h3>
    <p>
      We may update these Terms from time to time. The date of the latest version will be indicated, and continued use of
      the app after changes means you accept the updated Terms.
    </p>
